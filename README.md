## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

This challenge seemed simple at first, but it turned out to be more complex than expected. I had to utilize online resources, especially for implementing the mobile tooltip. I look forward to improving further by creating more webpages and continuing my learning journey.

### Useful resources
